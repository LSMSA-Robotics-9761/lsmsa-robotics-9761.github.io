# Robotics Documentation

**For FRC Team 9761**

There are a lot of important knowledge relevant to FRC Robotics that need to be passed on to other members and future years. To make things easier, this repository contains documentation for various aspects about the methodology that Team 9761 uses in FRC. This includes information in subjects like:

- Robot hardware
- Programming concepts
- Software
- ...and more

This documentation is not intended to be used by teams outside of 9761, especially since 9761's rookie year was 2024. Some of the information is rehashed from other places like the [WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html). Additionally, this documentation is not peer-reviewed so some information may be inaccurate. However, for those who are willing to read this documentation in-depth, there may be knowledge in this documentation that some teams find useful.
